# Autonomous-Cable-Layin-Robot


This code is for prototype of an autonomous cable laying robot. The purpose of the robot is to 
find the beacon and attach the wire to the beacon. The robot automatically avoids collisions, 
finds the beacon and disintegrates from the wire. 


# This project was class work for ENGR 120 @ UVIC.
